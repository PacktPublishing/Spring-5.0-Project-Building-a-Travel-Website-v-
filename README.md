## About the Video Course
Two main themes for Spring 5.0 projects are Reactive Programming and Microservices. The most significant change in the upcoming Spring 5.0 is the introduction of Reactive Programming, so reactive-style programming is used throughout the course. And since Microservice are the current buzzword, and Spring Boot is the most popular Microservice framework in the World, one volume will be dedicated to introducing Spring Boot and Spring Cloud in order to write the actual microservices.

We will build a fake travel site that will gradually take shape as we move on to each section. We'll start off by introducing the basics of Spring Framework, including bean lifecycles, Dependency Injection, AOP, and Spring Data. Then we'll introduce Reactive Programming in Spring 5, so you'll be ready to build the service layer for the travel site.In the further sections, you will learn to build the presentation layer, called Spring MVC.Here, we will start with Spring Boot, the Microservice framework based on Spring. 

By the end of the course, you will have built a couple of microservices for the Travel site using Spring Boot. We will make it as “Cloud Native” using Spring Cloud that helps to adopt the patterns like config server, circuit breaker, service discovery and etc.
